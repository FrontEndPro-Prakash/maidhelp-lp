            <p>For the use of the website, the delivery of goods or the provision of services, we collect various types of data, some of which are provided by you as a user and some of which are necessary for the use of the website or arise from the use of the website.

The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>  
            <p>If we use contracted service providers for individual functions of our offers via this website or would like to use your data for advertising purposes, we will inform you in detail about the respective processes below.

            <ol>
              <li>We protect your personal data by taking all reasonable and necessary technical and organizational possibilities so that they are not accessible to unauthorized third parties. Our website and other services offered through it therefore use appropriate encryption mechanisms for the provision of content and during the input and transmission of data. When communicating by e-mail, we also recommend the use of encryption for confidential information.</li>

              <li>If you send us e-mail messages or other messages, in particular comments, or enter them directly on the Website, we will retain such messages to process the request, respond to questions and improve the Website products, and services. We delete the data arising in this context after the storage is no longer necessary or limit the processing if statutory retention obligations exist.</li>
              <li>If you provide feedback (for example on the Website), we may use and disclose this feedback for any purpose, as long as we do not provide it with your personal data, i.e. anonymously or pseudonymously. The collection of data contained in such feedback and the handling of all personal data contained therein is in accordance with the data protection principles set out herein.</li>
              <li>You have the right to ask about your personal data free of charge at any time. Furthermore, you have the right at any time to revoke your consent to the use of your personal data with effect for the future and to request correction or deletion of the data stored by us.</li>
            </ol>
              <p>You have the following rights towards us with regard to the personal data related to you:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Right to access information,</li>
                <li>Right to correction or erasure,</li>
                <li>Right to limitation of processing,</li>
                <li>Right of withdrawal of the consent to processing,</li>
                <li>Right to data transferability.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personal data.</p>

            <ol>
              <li value="6">Data that is provided actively by you as user of the website or services:</li>
              <li>As far as the website or an action via our website requires a registration, the basic data for the registration, determined by the respective registration form are transmitted, processed, and stored and only collected, stored, and used for the use of the website and its services as well as the shop. In the context of such registration, we are also entitled to inform you about changes, additions or new versions of the website, changes of our terms and conditions as well as these privacy statement and additional information provided via the website as well as e.g. about new products.</li>
              <li>If you register for the subscription of a newsletter, this registration can take place under indication of the e-mail address without further data. The user can voluntarily provide further information when registering for the newsletter.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We use the so-called double opt-in procedure for sending the newsletter. As part of this process, we first send the user an e-mail to the specified e-mail address. However, the user will not receive a newsletter by e-mail until the user clicks on the link received in the e-mail and has expressly confirmed to us that we should activate the newsletter service. After your confirmation we will save your e-mail address only for the purpose of sending you the newsletter. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR</p>
            <p>We would like to point out that we evaluate your user behaviour when sending a newsletter. For this analysis, the e-mails sent contain so-called web beacons or tracking pixels, which represent single-pixel image files stored on our website. For evaluation purposes, we link the above data and web beacons to your e-mail address and an individual ID. You can object to this tracking at any time by clicking on the separate link provided in each e-mail or by informing us by another contact method. The information is stored for as long as you have subscribed to the newsletter. After a cancellation we store the data purely statistically and anonymously.</p>
            <p>If at any time you no longer wish to receive newsletters from us, you can object to the newsletter subscription at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates. A message in text form to the contact data specified in the imprint is sufficient for this. Of course, you will also find a unsubscribe link in every newsletter.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The data created by users within the scope of using the website via a login or a newsletter registration are stored on servers operated in our name. However, the server operators are subject to the same data protection standards as we are and are operated in the European Union.</li>
              <li>Use of the Online-Store</li>
              <li>If you would like to order in our Online-Store, it is necessary for the conclusion of the contract that you enter your personal data, which we need for the completion of your order. Required information for the execution of the contracts are marked separately, any further information is voluntary. We process the data provided by you to process your order. For this purpose, we can pass on your payment data to our payment service provider. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b GDPR.</li>
              <li>You can voluntarily create a customer account through which we can store your data for future purchases. When you create an account under “my account”, the data you have provided will be stored until you delete the data or request for deletion. All other data, including your user account, can always be deleted in the customer area.</li>
              <li>We may also process the information you provide to inform you of other interesting products in our portfolio or to send you e-mails containing technical information.</li>
              <li>Due to commercial and tax regulations, we are obliged to store your address, payment and order data for a period of ten years. However, after two years we will restrict processing, i.e. this data will only be used to comply with legal obligations.</li>
              <li>To prevent unauthorized access to your personal data, especially financial data, the order process is encrypted using TLS technology.</li>
